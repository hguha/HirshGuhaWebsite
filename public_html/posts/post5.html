        A lot of cooking invariably means a lot of cutting. And I mean, a LOT of cutting. Easily five times as much cutting as cooking. As a result, it is hard to understate the importance of a good chefs knife. Chef's around the world, both professional and home cooks, have their own opinion on what the best knife is, the perfect weight, edge, shape, length, color, you name it, it's probably up for debate. However, the one category that is probably the most debated, and in my opinion, the main thing you, the reader, need to take into considerationi is the whether you want a Japanese or German style knife.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Japanese</h3>
        These are the knives that I use. The primary difference is the forging methodolgy. In japan, they adhere to the older style of forging knives in heat, layering steel or carbon over and over sixty or more knives, and smashing these layers together to achieve a durable surface that can be sharpened to a razor edge on a grindstone while the metal is hot. Their is a history of craftsmanship here, and many japanese knife makers pride themselves on the attention and care given to each knive.

       <b>Pros</b>: These knives are wicked sharp. Have you seen those videos of people slicing tomatoes that are molecules thick? Or cutting cardboard like it's butter? Those are almost always done with japanese knives. This also also for much quicker cutting.
       <br>
       <b>Cons</b>: These knives tend to lose their edge much faster, and require some ability with whetstones to properly restore to that razor edge. In addition, because of the craftsmanship, these knives tend to be more expensize, starting around $80 and going way up from there if you choose.

It was given to me as a birthday gift from my girlfriend in 2018, and I still use it to this day. Through proper care, it has remained an irreplacable part of my cooking experience.

        <h3>German</h3>
        In obvious contrast, the Germans, masters of industrial production as they are, understood that prices can be brought down by mass producing knives in a way that does not require the literal liquifing of metal to create layers of damascus. Instead, they realized that if you had a really large, thin sheet of steel and a really well designed machine, you can simply use a stamp to punch perfectly shaped knives out of cold steel, and then sharpen them on a belt right there in the same machine. Stick a plastic, metal, or wooden handle on, and it's ready to be shipped.
        <br>
        <b>Pros</b>: These knives tend to be very cheap, starting at maybe $5 dollars, and because of capitalism, are far more available in your local stores. 
        <br>
       <b>Cons</b>: These knives tend to be duller, heavier, less wieldly(as a result of them being massproduced instead of handcrafted) and harder to sharpen.
       <br><br>

        Ultimately, it's true that the best knife in the world is the one that you feel most comfortable with. With a whetstone, or a honing rod, or one of those new knife sharpening gadgets, any knife can perform like a champ. If your dollar store made right here in America is easier to use and easier to store, that's the one you should use. But don't make such a decision without at least experiencing what a higher quality knife can bring you. Use my knife or use another, but do so informed with what your options are!
