        I am a lover of meat, and I know that I would struggle to go vegetarian for even a week. However, I also do my best to get a good ammouint of veggies in my life, and with a vegetarian girlfriend, I am also looking for dishes that are easily done with or without meat. Fried Rice is a great way for me to do just that - make a tasty dish packed full of veggies to be eaten by itself, or with any sort of meat-based main dish.

        The important thing about this recipe is not to follow it to a T - it is instead to understand the techniques and timing so that you can add your favorite toppings to any rice and make it your own signature fried rice that makes a perfect 30 minute week night meal. Below, I will simply describe how I made the rice show above
        <br><br>
        <b>Prep:</b> 10mins, <b>Cook:</b> 20mins, <b>Serves:</b> 5-8
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup mushrooms(can be pre-chopped or whole)</li>
            <li>1/2 an onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup carrots, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper(I used an orange one, but color doesn't matter), chopped</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups long-grained white rice, washed</li>
            <li>2 tbsp MSG(optional)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soysauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sriracha or other chinese chili sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp neutral-flavored oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the white rice ahead of time, as you like it. Refrigerate while you chop the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Heat a wok or heavy bottom pan(I used a dutch oven), and add the oil, onions and mushrooms. After 4-5 minutes, add the carrots and bell pepper</li>
            <li>Push the veggies to the edges of the pan or wok, and crack in 4 eggs. Stir the eggs to create a loose scrable, and let cook until very large curds from. </li>
            <li>Add your rice from the refrigerator, on top of the eggs. Begin stirring all the ingredients together. Let fry for 3-5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add garlic powder, chili sauce, and soy sauce, and MSG. Mix well into the fried rice.</li>
            <li>Finally, add frozen peas and turn the heat off. The residual heat will cook the peas without turning them mushy or removing the green color</li>
        </ol>

        As you can see by the ingredients, I believe a good fried rice is roughly half rice and half other ingredients. I have also come to learn that you need less soy sauce than you think. However, I want to reiterate that fried rice is dish that is extremely personal, and trial and error is absolutely necessary to make the dish that you will feel comfortable making time and time again.
