        Jack of all trades. Master of None.

One of the oldest pastimes of mankind since mankind itself was a species was to well, think. To consider that which is around us and to attempt to make sense of it. This epistemological desire is something we call philosophy. And indeed, it’s philosophy that has born many of the greatest questions that exist even to this day. Such dichotomies such as Nature vs Nurture, or The Social Contracts that give life to organized civilization, or various ethical idealisms are ideas that personally enjoy thinking about. Though there is no objective “correctness” in any such philosophy, there is one debate that has defined my whole life, and yet I cannot bring myself to agree with either side: “Breadth vs Depth”.
<br><br>
The idea here is simply the question of whether it is “better” to focus on expanding one’s abilities and skills into as many different ventures as possible, or whether it would be more useful to pick one ability and skill and hone that to perfection. Certainly it would be ideal if one could not only be able to be good at everything, but truly excel in all of those disciplines. Unfortunately, our time on Earth is limited, and we are relegated to picking our battles when it comes to choosing how to honing our abilities. Would I be able to become the next Usain Bolt AND the next Mozert AND the next Picasso AND the next Albert Einstein? Obviously not, but perhaps if I had dedicated my entire life and worked as hard as they did in just one of their respective crafts, I could have approached a level of skill that’s even remotely in line with theres(obviously there are many other factors to their virtuoso like abilities). So alas, one must choose whether it’s better to be the jack of all trades, or the master of one.
<br><br>
And certainly there are arguments for and against both sides.

Bruce Lee is someone I admire greatly, and famously said "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”. Another area that this is relevant is college admissions. On one hand, is the student who took played 6 instruments, was the president of 10 clubs, did 4 different sports, took every AP course available, and volunteered at every event the one who is more likely to be accepted into Harvard, or is the student who is simply one of the best 18-year-olds in there world at rowing more likely to get in? From my experience, it’s unequivocally the second one.
<br><br>
But on the other hand, there are so many areas where I feel that I need to put time and attention to, and neglecting that abilities in exchange for single-minded focus would be harmful. 
<br><br>
Making bread is an art-form unto itself, and no small task. One must be careful with choosing the correct bread flour for its higher protein content. One must ensure the yeast is alive, and consider whether to use a starter or not. Hydration levels are no small task to perfect. Then, gluten development to the appropriate level and kneading or an autolyse has to be used. Finally, shaping and baking until a perfectly good loaf is created. But one can’t focus entirely on bread, for the cheese is equally relevant. Some estimates say there are more than 1800 varieties of cheese. Different levels of aging, moisture, funk, tenderness, softness, and many other variables go into knowing what the perfect cheese is. The cheese one uses for a queso dip is generally not the same one used on pizza, and certainly not the same one used on a ham and cheese sandwich. And if bread and cheese were not enough to master, ham itself is a fickle one. Black Forest? Boiled? Bayonne? Capicola? Country Style? Should it be thinly sliced, or thick cut? What seasons will be applied? Is chewer better than tender?
<br><br>
You see, to make the perfect ham and cheese sandwich requires a breath of skills that are certainly all worth taking the time to appreciate and learn. Thus, the answer to the great “breadth vs depth” debate can be answered succinctly and clearly: “Make the perfect ham and cheese sandwich, and you will know”.
