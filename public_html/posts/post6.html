        As with the majority, I love pizza. Unfortunately pizza is not a dish that lends itself well to the home kitchen.
        
        
        It's hours of prep, what with proofing a yeast-leavened dough that can be strenuous to knead without proper equipment. In addition, a properly blistered crust has to be cooked at temperatures far exceeding the average home oven, either requiring an hour of preheating a pizza stone/steel at the highest temperature, or buying an expensive pizza oven.
        <br><br>
        What if I told you that you can make a delivious, albiet very non-traditional, pizza in about 15 minutes, start to finish, and for only $1?
        <br><br>
        The trick? A pita, naan, tortilla, or another flat bread. It solves the issue of needing high temperatures, requiring a ton of work to create them, and you can buy 8 of them at the store for like, $2.

        <b>Prep:</b> 20mins, <b>Cook:</b> 3hrs
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup toppings to cook(think pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, etc.)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh toppingsthink cream cheese, basil, garlic, tomato slices, etc.)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of shredded or fresh mozzerella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 flatbread(I use tortilla)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place flatbread on a appropriate sized baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place flatbread on a appropriate sized baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread marinara sauce edge to edge on the pizza, leaving as much uncovered bread as you like for the crust.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese and toppings that need to be cooked, and once the oven is preheated, place it in for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the pizza is out, immediately add fresh toppings, let rest for 5 minutes, and cut into 4 slices to serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The Formula</h3>
        What I sought to provide here is not an exact recipe to necessarily follow to the tee, but rather a schematic for an easy weeknight meal. The formula is:
        <ol>
            <li>flat bread - naan, tortilla, pita, etc.</li>
            <li>Sauce - marinara, alfredo, hummus, olive oil, etc.</li>
            <li>Cooked Toppings - mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage, chicken</li>
            <li>Fresh Toppings - Basil, parsley, spinach, tomato, onion, etc.</li>
        </ol>
        
        No matter what wild choices you make with each of the 4 categories, there's an extremely high probability that the dish will come out tasty. It's unbelievably cheap, very low calorie compared to a traditional pizza, and so fast to make. Give it a shot!
