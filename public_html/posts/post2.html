            As is mentioned a couple of times, in a couple of places around my website, I enjoy a variety of food and I take cooking/food prep to be a serious passion of mine that I devote a reasonable ammount of time to. A natural question that arises is "what is my favorite food?". The answer to this question is somewhat elaborative, but certainly when going to <em>any</em> fast food place, my answer is a chicken sandwich.

        <br><br>
        For my fellow chicken sandwich lovers, I took the time to venture to 7 different fast food locations serving chick sandwiches, and have rated each on a number of categories to ultimately help you make decisions next time you're deciding on a drive through for the best sandwich!<br><br>

                <h3>Slim Chicken($4)</h3>
                This sandwich was altogether inferior. The bread was soft and mushy. The breading on the fried chicken was thin, and had no crunch that is expected of a fried chicken sandwich. There was very little, if any sauce on the sandwich, and the pickles were overly moist(though not un-tasty). While it was fine sized and filling, it was not worth the price tag.

                <h3>Raising Canes($4)</h3>
                This sandwich is nothing more than slightly higher quality than Slim Chicken's. It offers the same cuts of chicken on very similar bread. The sandwich is roughly the same price and size. It does have lettuce instead of a pickle. However, the breading on the chicken was slightly superior. I also receieved more chicken than on Slim Chicken's, but it is more likely that the difference was purely a result of probability of the sandwiches I was given.

                <h3>McDonalds($1)</h3>
                Considering it is on the dollar menu, it is hard to critique since that you are getting a reasonable ammount of chicken and bread for that price is already worth something. At one point many years ago, it was a phenomenal sandwich, with good breaded chicken, lettuce, mayo, and maybe even a tomato if you were lucky. Now, it is breaded chicken and lettuce on a bun. The bun is squished, and the lettuce's lack of crunch removes any textural components.

            <h3>Local Restaurant (Burger Stand at the Casbah)($10)</h3>
            A local restaurant favorite of mine in the Burger Stand in Downtown Lawrence, Kansas. It is large, comes with avacado, romaine lettuce(a welcome change to the iceburg that is so common), tomato, grilled chicken, and a variety of sauces to quench any needs. The bread is high quality, and it is clear the chicken was cooked immediately before serving. The reason it is not higher on this list is purely due to the price tag. As you will see, there are sandwiches that are as good for a fraction of the price.

                <h3>Burger King($3)</h3>
            </li>
            The fact that Burger King's chicken sandwich dwarfs McDonalds came as a surprise to me. It is quite a bit more expensive, though I do feel $3 as satisfied when I eat this, so I believe it justified. It has a spicy variety, which I believe is some chili powder that is mixed into the chicken breading, is much larger, and has more toppings. Namely, lettuce, tomato, and a reasonable ammount of mayo. There is a Burger King in almost any city in the world, so it quite easy to come by.

                <h3>Homemade($3)</h3>
                Making the bare-bones sandwich that would compete with any of these on the list is simple. Fry chicken thighs using a classic 3-stage battering situation, make your favorite special sauce(usually some combination of mayo, ketchup, and mustard, along with a special twist like pickle juice), choose one or two toppings(I do tomato and spinch), and throw them on a toasted bun. It's an excellent sandwich, because <em>you</em> made it. However, it requires quite a bit of work, maybe 30 minutes or so to get all the ingridents prepped, fry the chicken, assemble the sandwich, and eat. In addition, if you are using high quality ingridents, the prices can get a little higher, even though you can probably make more sandwiches with one batch of ingridents. My estimate is around $3 per sandwich.

                <h3>Popeyes($4)</h3>
                This is a perfect sandwich. It far outclasses anything I can make at home. The bread is light, fluffy, flavorful, and maybe even buttered. The breading on the chicken is unbeliavly crispy and full. If you get the spicy version of the sandwich, you can taste paprika, cayenne, and chili powder. The chicken thigh they place on the bread is comically large, spilling out of the bread. The pickles and sauce are a perfect sweet and sour combo to pierce through the richness. If you have a popeyes and have not tried their chicken sandwich, I unequvically believe you are missing out.
