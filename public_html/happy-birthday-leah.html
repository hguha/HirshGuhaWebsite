    <div class="title"> Dear Leah,</div>

    <div>Unfortunately, I do not have your drawing skills nor your creativity to make a card like you made me. I do love
        that card quite a bit. I read it probably about once a week just to remind myself what pure love feels like. So
        I'd like to offer you something similar, and this is the best I could come up with :). There will be no
        particular order or organization to this. I will write this all at once and not edit it and it's gonna be
        chaotic and messy, but I sort of think that's appropriate. I feel chaos all the time and it's only with you that
        I get any respite to that. So for your birthday, I'd like to offer you a glimpse into that.

        The first thing I wanted to say is that I do struggle to talk about my feelings. I'm sure you're more than aware
        of that, obviously there are many times you notice and ask if I'm okay just to get a stony "I'm fine", but I'm
        sure there are also times you notice but you don't say anything because you can't quite tell and don't want to
        push any boundaries. I'm aware of this, particularly because you and you alone make me feel comfortable to talk
        about things that I wouldn't otherwise say to literally anyone else. I don't know if that will come as a
        surprise to you, but there are things I'd even be uncomfortable to tell my dad or sister that I want to tell
        you.

        You make me feel vulnerable, but more importantly, like it's okay to be vulnerable. Thank you for that.

        Obviously you know that I do my best to learn from past relationships. Not only to learn what I can do better,
        but also to learn what I should and should not accept in my life. To notice red flags that I otherwise would not
        have known about. To study human behavior for better and for worse. Here's what's weird: you have no red flags.
        I consistently struggle to find anything to fault you for. There's not one compromise I feel that I have to make
        in this relationship.

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="number">- 2.5 -</div>

        I can imagine there are many compromises you have to make for me, and I am aware of that and doing my best to
        become better for you. To learn from you. You deserve better than the best.

        I've known you for 4 months and in that time you've added more value to my life than previous relationships have
        added in 3 years. It's ridiculous. I am a better person because of you, and I feel less stressed because of you
        and I feel happier and lighter because of you and that's just not fair, is it?

    No one makes me laugh as much as you. Your quick wit continues to blow my mind even to this day.

        I know sometimes you make comments about how you look. And obviously me telling you that I find you pretty is
        not going to alone change your whole mindset. But god. I hope you believe that when I say that I brag to my
        friends about how pretty my girl is, I'm not even a little bit joking. You know I have very very few photos on
        my phone in general. Most are of food and my dogs. The next thing I have the most photos of is well, you. It was
        not at all on purpose, but I'm so so okay with that.

        You have such a nice smile. Straight up brightens my day to see it, even a picture or on video. Makes me a tiny
        bit happier. That's on you. Just a smile. Just you.

        You simultaneously ground me to reality while making me feel like I can do anything. How do you do it?

        You're one of my best friends. I believe in my heart that no matter what happens in the future, you will always
        be or will have been one of my best friends.

        I have one million things I want to do with you and by the time we do all of them, I'll have another couple
        million things I'll want to do with you

        Thank you for being in my life, Leah Catherine Wambeke. I know neither of us is particularly religious, though I
        know we both wonder if there is something greater out there. Some spirit or god or deity or energy or whatever
        word you want to use. I often wonder if there's a concept of fate or destiny or that there are certain things
        that were meant to happen - that everything isn't random and coincidence. You help me wonder that, because how
        else could I have gotten so absolutely lucky if not for some divine intervention? If soulmates are real, then
        you are as close as I will ever get and I'm so so okay with that.
