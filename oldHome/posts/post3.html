        Ever since I bought a dutch oven, I have been really into braising various meats. It is easy to cook in bulk, it offers a superior texture and sear to an Instapot(though both will make the meat very tender) and is way easier to clean than a cast iron. I think this recipe is a perfect combination of sweet and savory, and great for a winter night meal. <br><br>
        <b>Prep:</b> 20mins, <b>Cook:</b> 3hrs
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>20oz pork roast</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>1 large sweet apple(Fuji, Gala, and Honeycrsip are good)</li>
            <li>2 roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>1tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2cup white wine</li>
            <li>1cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2tbsp oil(I use avacado oil)</li>
            <li>2tbsp flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn the heat on high under a dutch oven, or some highwalled pan. Pour in 1tbsp of oil, and sear the pork roast on all sides until deep golden. Move the roast onto a seperate plate to rest.</li>
            <li>Dice onion, tomatoes, and garlic reasonably finely. Cut apple up into half-inch to quarter-inch cubes. In the same pan that the roast was seared in, turn on medium heat and throw the rest of the oil in, along with the onion, tomatoes and garlic. Cook until all the solids are quite mushy and soft. Add the tomato paste apple, and flour cook for another 3-4 minutes until the fond on the bottom of the pan looks close to burning.
            </li>
            <li>Slowly whisk in white wine and chicken stock while scrapping the bottom clean of fond. Add sugar, salt and pepper, the pork roast, along with any juices back into the pot. If you have any other spices you want to add, now is the time.</li>
            <li>Turn the burner on as low as it will go, close the lid on the pot, and let simmer for 3-4hours, depending on how tender you want your meat.</li>
            <li>Once the time is done, you can optionally gently remove the roast from the braising liquid, strain the liquid to get totally smooth gravy, and add the roast back in. I usually skip this, as I imagine biting into the onions and apples.</li>
            <li>Serve in a bowl by itself, or next to mashed potatoes.</li>
        </ol>
